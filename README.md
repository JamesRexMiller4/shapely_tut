LEARNING ABOUT MAKING MAPS WITH PYTHON, :)


Notes:

# Datums

Datums are needed to accurately represent the shape, size, and orientation of the Earth’s surface in geospatial data. They are typically represented by an ellipsoid or geoid and are used to define the shape of the Earth’s surface in geographic and projected coordinate reference systems. Common datums include WGS84, NAD83, ETRF89, UTM, and SPCS.

# Common Projections
Here are some examples of commonly used projections:
• Mercator projection: This is a cylindrical projection that pre- serves the direction of true north and is often used for navigation. However, it distorts the size and shape of objects near the poles, making Greenland and Antarctica appear much larger than they actually are.
• Lambert Conformal Conic projection: This projection is com- monly used for maps of the United States and Canada. It pre- serves the shape and size of objects near the standard parallel(s), but distorts them elsewhere on the map.
• Albers Equal Area projection: This projection preserves area, making it useful for maps that require accurate comparisons of different regions’ sizes. It is commonly used for maps of the United States and other countries.
• Robinson projection: This is a compromise projection that at- tempts to balance the preservation of area, shape, and distance. It is a popular projection for world maps due to its attractive and well-balanced appearance.
